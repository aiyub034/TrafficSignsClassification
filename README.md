# TrafficSignsClassification
An end-to-end traffic sign classification system using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The workflow begins with automated ingestion of traffic-sign images organized by class folders, followed by dataset construction, exploratory visualization, and class-distribution analysis.
